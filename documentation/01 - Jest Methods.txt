1) .only, .skip and .todo
=========================
Sometimes you want to skip some test because the implementation for passing those tests will take time.
- .only: Only run test/describe with .only specified.
- .skip: Don't run any test/describe with .skip specified. Runs all other tests.
- .todo: It is to remind you to wire a particular test later. Generally not used as much.

To use the test, you need to postfix the keyword with describe or test.
Example:
- describe.only
- test.todo('Invalid Test'); //Note you don't add the implementation
